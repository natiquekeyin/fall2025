Promises:
    "Are just like real world promises"

    A promise is either resolve(fullfilled) OR it is reject(not fullfilled)

Syntax of Promises in JS:
    let p = new Promise(resolve,reject); resolve and reject are two callback methods. 

    resolve( ) is called when promise is fullfilled
    reject( ) is called when promise is rejected...

fetch API:

fetch API actually returns a promise!

fetch API returns a promise!... p.then().then().catch()
fetch().then().then()


Async/Await functions:
 We make "async" functions that can have "await" statements, that actually await for something to be resolved or a promise to be fullfilled or rejected...
