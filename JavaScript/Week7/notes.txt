Asynchronous Programming:
    Sometimes we want some code to wait for the other, before executing so that we can see the right results. Like in our posts example..where createPost() is taking 3 seconds and before its completion the getPosts() runs and it just dipslay the old output, but not the post4 created by createPost() WHY??? since it is not completed yet...

    1. Callback Functions
    2. Promises
    3. async/await functions

    Some APIs that can be used to implement asynchronous behaviour in javascript!

    1. XmlHttpRequest
    2. Fetch API


    JSON data format: JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) is a string format in which most of the web data flows these days(previously XML). But now JSON is the standard format for transporting the data or saving data in browswer memory...

    let user = {first_name:"Alan", last_name:"Smith"} Normal JavaScript...(console.log(user.first_name))

    let user = {"first_name":"Alan", "last_name":"Smith", "age":20} JSON format (We cannot access the fields of json object directly) [console.log(user.first_name) NO: Why? becasue the given data is JSON and JSON canot be read like normal javascript object]

To convert a JSON object into normal JS object(so that I can access its fields) we use the function JSON.parse({"id":2}) -> {id:2}NOW I can access id as a field...

To convert normal JS object into JSON we use 
JSON.stringify({id:2})...> {"id":2}
