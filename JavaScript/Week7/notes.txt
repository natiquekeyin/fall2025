Asynchronous Programming:
    Sometimes we want some code to wait for the other, before executing so that we can see the right results. Like in our posts example..where createPost() is taking 3 seconds and before its completion the getPosts() runs and it just dipslay the old output, but not the post4 created by createPost() WHY??? since it is not completed yet...

    1. Callback Functions
    2. Promises
    3. async/await functions

    Some APIs that can be used to implement asynchronous behaviour in javascript!

    1. XmlHttpRequest
    2. Fetch API
