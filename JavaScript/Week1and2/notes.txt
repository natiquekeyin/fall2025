How to run JavaScript?

1. By using browser REPL: Read Evaluate Process and Loop
2. By linking a js file with HTML (As we have done before)

[For above, we are developing/using the webbrowser files or websites]

3. We can use JS to make console/desktop applications ALSO... by using "node.js" and saving script file and running that... node js REPL

Declaring Variables in JS:
 1. let x =10;
 2. var y = 20; (Older / legacy way of declaring variables..)
 3. const z = 30;


 Operators in JS:
    Arithematic Operators: +, - , * , / , %
    Assignment Operator: = 
    Arithematic Assignment:  += , -= , *=
    Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, -- 
        Pre-Increment/ Post Increment

    let x=10;
    x = x+5;// instead of this
    x+=5;
