Welcome to JavaScript

How to run JavaScript?

1. By using browser REPL: Read Evaluate Process and Loop
2. By linking a js file with HTML (As we have done before)

[For above, we are developing/using the webbrowser files or websites]

3. We can use JS to make console/desktop applications ALSO... by using "node.js" and saving script file and running that... node js REPL

Declaring Variables in JS:
 1. let x =10;
 2. var y = 20; (Older / legacy way of declaring variables..)
 3. const z = 30;


 Operators in JS:
    Arithematic Operators: +, - , * , / , %  [ x + ]
    Assignment Operator: = 
    Arithematic Assignment:  += , -= , *=
    Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, -- [Unary Opertor][x++][++x]
    Ternary Operator(Conditional operator):

    ? : [short form for if else - But remember this ternary operator will be used MANY times in React where we CANNOT use if else...]
    operand_1 ? operand_2 : operand_3 
    condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false 

    variable naming rules:

    i)The variable name should start with a letter
       x1; 1x WRONG; abc123, abc_something, _x
    ii)No spaces in the variable name..
    iii) x and X are two different variables...

    Naming Conventions:
    
    let first name; WRONG...
    let first_name; CORRECT...
    let first-name; CORRECT..
    let firstName; CORRECT...

    1. camelCase
    firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth
    2. PascalCase
    FirstName, LastName, dateOfBirth
    3. snake_case
    first_name, last_name, date_of_birth
    4. kebab-case [CSS]
    first-name, last-name, date-of-birth 
    background-color:blue; font-size:1rem

Statement: 
In JS statements are terminated(optionally) with a semi colon (;)[statement terminator]


Block in JS:
collection of few statements surrounded by {  }
{
    {

    }
}

JS program execution:
1. Sequential 
2. Conditional
3. Looping:
    for loop??
    for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){


    }
    NESTED LOOP: (loop within a loop)
4. Jumping/Functions
