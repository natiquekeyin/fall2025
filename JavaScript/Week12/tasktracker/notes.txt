State in React:


Temp folder in components will hold temporarily those components that we will create for practice/testing purpose but they are not the part of our project..


     const [x,setX] =useState(0);     // actually creates a "state" variable and assigns "0" to it.

    console.log(x); // Output: 0

    x=x+2; NOT THE RIGHT WAY OF CHANGIN A STATE VARIABLE..

    setX(x+2); 

    console.log(x);

    console.log(x); // Output: 


      const [name,setName] =useState("Alan"); // creates a state varaible and assigns "Alan" as the default/initialized value of that variable.

      name = "Bob"; NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo

    setName("Bob"); RIGHT WAY OF CHANGING NAME VARIABLE...



      const [y,setY]=useState(false); creates a state variable which is boolean and assigns "false" as the defaul/initial values

      console.log(y);

      y=true; NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooo

      setY(true);

      Return 2 things:
      i) Reference/name of the variable
      ii) The function to manipulate this variable....

      x=x+5




       {/* <USComponent /> */}
      {/* <USWithObject1 /> */}
      {/* <USWithArray /> */}


      Primarily we try to store everything in App.jsx to make it globally accessible...
      We define evertying in App.jsx and from there onward we pass each thing into respective component and use it there....
      

  Another Hook in React: 
  
  useEffect() ...
  It creates/provides side effects when we render/re-render a component 

  useEffect runs with every rendering/re-re ndering of a component...

  useEffect might run:
    i) With every rendering and re-rendering
    ii) With ONLY first time running of the component [ ]
    iii) With every change in a particular state variable....[variable]
